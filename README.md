expansion of multinomial expressions "(-3x - 5y + 2z)^4"

Expands to:

~~~

(-3x - 5y + 2z) ^4 =
81x^4 + 540x^3y - 216x^3z + 1350x^2y^2 - 1080x^2yz + 216x^2z^2 + 1500xy^3 - 1800xy^2z + 720xyz^2 - 96xz^3 + 625y^4 - 1000y^3z + 600y^2z^2 - 160yz^3 + 16z^4

It is a toy, although it does its one task well, with error messages, error
handling and all.

It was mostly an experiment:

* Use lex to parse command line arguments.

* Do symbolic math.


There is no manual, maybe there will be, but not long. I might use it as a 
front end for a calculator, or I may not.
